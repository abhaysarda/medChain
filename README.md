Medical blockchain

We currently working on developing a decentralized record management and storage system using blockchain techology and a distributed file storage system (IPFS), respectively. Our main motivation behind working on such a technology is to have a clean and permanent log of a patientâ€™s health records, fast and easy access to these records across providers, and data confidentiality, authentication, and legitimacy. My main inspiration comes from the Medrec prototype by MIT Media Labs. We will be building a similar model based on securing the network using the Proof-of-Work concept and look forward to investigating other/better options in the future.
